This gem contains the OpenStreetMap strategy for OmniAuth.

OpenStreetMap uses the OAuth 1.0a flow, you can read about it here: http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OAuth

## How To Use It

Usage is as per any other OmniAuth 1.0 strategy. So let's say you're using Rails, you need to add the strategy to your `Gemfile` along side omniauth:

    gem 'omniauth'
    gem 'omniauth-osm'

Of course if one or both of these are unreleased, you may have to pull them in directly from github e.g.:

    gem 'omniauth', :git => 'https://github.com/intridea/omniauth.git'
    gem 'omniauth-osm', :git => 'https://github.com/sozialhelden/omniauth-osm.git'

Once these are in, you need to add the following to your `config/initializers/omniauth.rb`:

    Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
      provider :osm, "consumer_key", "consumer_secret"
    end

If you are using devise, this is how it looks like in your `config/initializers/devise.rb`:

    config.omniauth :osm, "consumer_key", "consumer_secret"

You will obviously have to put in your key and secret, which you get when you register your app with OpenStreetMap.

Now just follow the README at: https://github.com/intridea/omniauth

## Other Servers

If you would like to use this plugin against another OSM server, such as the test development server you can use the environment variable OSM_AUTH_SITE to set the server to connect to.

You could for example use the gem figaro to configure the environment variable, or roll your own preinitialiser similar to the OpenStreetMap website.

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests

- Fork the project.
- Make your feature addition or bug fix.
- Add tests for it. This is important so I donâ€™t break it in a future version unintentionally.
- Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
- Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
